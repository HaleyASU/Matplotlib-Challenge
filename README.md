# Matplotlib-Challenge
Module 5 Challenge - applying what I've learned about Matplotlib to a real world situation and dataset by generating tables and figures needed for a technical report of a clinical study. 

I had help with my code from Tutor Angel Milla as well as ChatGPT. 
I've left comments throughout my code specifying what help I recieved and from which source.
